# CSE 160: Introduction to Parallel Computing Assignment 2

Project Overview: The goal of this assignment is to parallelize a given serial code that uses a simple iteration to solve the final temperature distribution on a plate using so-called Dirichlet (fixed temperature) boundary conditions. Two different versions are created for parallelizing: column-wise distribution and row-wise distributon.
